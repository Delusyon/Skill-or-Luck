# Skill-or-Luck
This is my version of skill or luck statistic based on veritasium video on this subject. 

I changed a few things, including:
  population size = 1000
  sample size = 10

Other variable are the same:
  skill chance = 0.95
  luck change = 0.05
  bootstrap value = 1000

pardon for the messy code, i am an amateur programmer. I tried my best to make the code readable.
